My name is David Jackson
I’m currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, with minors in Physics and Mathematics (Expected graduation: Spring 2026).
I’m deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially in fields related to Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.
