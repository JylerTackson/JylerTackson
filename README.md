Hi there, I'm David Jackson 👋
🔭 I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, with minors in Physics and Mathematics (Expected graduation: Dec 2026).
👀 I’m deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially in fields related to Autonomous Systems, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.
🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Genetic Algorithms.
💼 I’m working on exciting projects such as:
Autonomous Drone Project: Developing a system using TensorFlow for real-time object detection and tracking. Integrating hand gesture recognition for remote control and utilizing GitHub for collaboration and version control.
ACMSE Hackathon Project: Collaborated with a team to analyze financial data using Pandas and optimized buy/sell decisions through a Genetic Algorithm.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-driven projects, especially in drone technology and autonomous systems.
